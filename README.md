# Data Science Notebooks

Data science Python notebooks—a collection of Jupyter notebooks on machine learning, deep learning, statistical inference, data analysis and visualization.

This repo contains various Python Jupyter notebooks I have created to experiment and learn with the core libraries essential for working with data in Python and work through exercises, assignments, course works, and explore subjects that I find interesting such as machine learning and deep learning. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed.

The essential core libraries that I will be focusing on for working with data are NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Caffe, scikit-learn, spaCy, NLTK, Gensim, and related packages.

## How to Use this Repo

- Run the code using the Jupyter notebooks available in this repository's [notebooks](/notebooks) directory.
- Launch a live notebook server with these notebooks using [binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/): [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cedrickchee/data-science-notebooks/blob/master/notebooks/index.ipynb/master)

## About

The notebooks were written and tested with Python 3.6, though other Python versions (including Python 3.x) should work in nearly all cases.

See [index.ipynb](/notebooks/index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available.

## Software

The code in the notebook was tested with Python 3.6, though most (but not all) will also work correctly with Python 3.x.

The packages I used to run the code in the notebook are listed in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) (Note that some of these exact version numbers may not be available on your platform: you may have to tweak them for your own use). To install the requirements using conda, run the following at the command-line:

```bash
$ conda install --file requirements.txt
```

To create a stand-alone environment named DSN with Python 3.6 and all the required package versions, run the following:

```bash
$ conda create -n DSN python=3.5 --file requirements.txt
```

You can read more about using conda environments in the [Managing Environments](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html) section of the conda documentation.
