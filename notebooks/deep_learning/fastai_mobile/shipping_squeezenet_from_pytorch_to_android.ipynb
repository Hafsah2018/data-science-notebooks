    "\n",
    "- Network architecture: SqueezeNet 1.1\n",
    "- Real-time image classification from video stream\n",
    "- Performance: average 3 fps (frames per second)\n",

    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deploy mobile config and the models to devices.\n",
    "- Instantiate a Caffe2 instance (Android) or caffe2::Predictor instance (iOS) to expose the model to your Java or iOS code.\n",
    "- Pass inputs to the model and get outputs back.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objects in graph\n",
    "\n",

    "- caffe2::Predictor - stateful class that is instantiated with an \"initialization\" NetDef and a \"predict\" NetDef, and executes the \"predict\" NetDef with the input and returns the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mobile app layout in pure C++\n",
    "\n",
    "- Caffe2 core library, composed of the Workspace, Blob, Net, and Operator classes.\n",
    "- Caffe2 operator library, a range of Operator implementations (such as convolution, etc)\n",
    "- Non-optional dependencies:\n",
    "  - Google Protobuf (the lite version, around 300kb)\n",
    "  - Eigen, a BLAS (on Android) is required for certain primitives, and a vectorized vector/matrix manipulation library, and Eigen is the fastest benchmarked on ARM.\n",
    "- NNPACK, which specifically optimizes convolutions on ARM\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A model consists of two partsâ€”a set of weights that represent the learned parameters (updated during training), and a set of 'operations' that form a computation graph that represent how to combine the input data (that varies with each graph pass) with the learned parameters (constant with each graph pass). The parameters (and intermediate states in the computation graph live in a Caffe2 Workspace (like TensorFlow Session), where a Blob represents an arbitrary typed pointer, typically a TensorCPU, which is an *n-*dimensional array (like PyTorchâ€™s Tensor).\n",
    "\n",
    "The core class is caffe2::Predictor, which exposes the constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c++\n",
    "Predictor(const NetDef& init_net, const NetDef& predict_net)\n",
    "```\n",
    "where the two `NetDef` inputs are Google Protocol Buffer objects that represent the 2 computation graphs described above:\n",
    "- the `init_net` typically runs a set of operations that deserialize weights into the Workspace\n",
    "- the `predict_net` specifies how to execute the computation graph for each input\n",
    "\n",
    "The Predictor is a stateful class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently Caffe2 is optimized for ARM CPUs with NEON (basically any ARM CPU since 2012). There are other advantages to offloading compute onto the GPU/DSP, and it's an active work in progress to expose these in Caffe2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a convolutional implementation, it is recommended to use NNPACK since that's substantially faster (around 2x-3x) than the standard `im2col/sgemm` implementation used in most frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-convolutional (e.g. ranking) workloads, the key computational primitive are often fully-connected layers (e.g. FullyConnectedOp in Caffe2, InnerProductLayer in Caffe, nn.Linear in Torch). For these use cases, you can fall back to a BLAS library, specifically Accelerate on iOS and Eigen on Android.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Memory considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The model for memory usage of an instantiated and run Predictor is that itâ€™s the sum of the size of the weights and the total size of the activations. There is no â€˜staticâ€™ memory allocated, all allocations are tied to the Workspace instance owned by the Predictor, so there should be no memory impact after all Predictor instances are deleted."
