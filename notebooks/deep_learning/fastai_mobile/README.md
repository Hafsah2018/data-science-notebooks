## Background

This work is part of our project while studying [fast.ai's Deep Learning for Coders, Part 1 version 3 course](https://forums.fast.ai/c/part1-v3). I joined fast.ai Live—the new version of International Fellowships this year, thanks to Jeremy and Rachel.

The idea for this project originated from [Sanyam (init27)](https://forums.fast.ai/u/init_27)'s Not Hotdog mobile app idea while we were looking for possible projects which we can take on together or even individually. At the point during our discussions, we realized that shipping a neural network on iOS with CoreML with PyTorch is really a painful experience. Just take a look at this blog post, ["How I Shipped a Neural Network on iOS with CoreML, PyTorch, and React Native"](https://attardi.org/pytorch-and-coreml) written by Stefano J. Attardi to understand the state and scale of this problem. We are motivated by the size of the problem and the potentials, for example, [developers are offering consulting services to convert neural networks to run on mobile devices](http://machinethink.net/faster-neural-networks/).

### Project Goal

The plan: work on this project together and publish a blog post series.

## The Project

Port SqueezeNet, a small CNN into mobile phone and build a simple Android and iOS app.

- High-level activities:
  - Research and design an efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for on-device/mobile vision.
    - Design a mobile-first computer vision models for PyTorch, designed to effectively maximize accuracy while being mindful of the restricted resources for an on-device application—better than SqueezeNet!
    - Benchmark: SqueezeNet v1.1 vs. MobileNetV2 vs. Shufflenet
  - Build a Not Hotdog classifier using the new mobile-first CV model in PyTorch
    - Train, deploy and run on iOS and Android devices.

## Mobile-First Computer Vision

### Models and Network Architectures

Quick literature review:

- MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications (submitted on 17 Apr 2017)
  - Separable convolution
  - The important point here is that the bottleneck of the computational cost is now conv1x1!
- ShuffleNet: an extremely efficient convolutional neural network for mobile devices (submitted on 4 Jul 2017 (v1), last revised 7 Dec 2017 (this version, v2))
  - While conv1x1 is already efficient and there seems to be no room for improvement, grouped conv1x1 can be used for this purpose!
- MobileNetV2: Inverted Residuals and Linear Bottlenecks (Submitted on 13 Jan 2018 (v1), last revised 2 Apr 2018 (this version, v3))
  - [MobileNet version 2](http://machinethink.net/blog/mobilenet-v2/)
    - It's faster, uses less memory, and is better at conserving battery power.
    - Another option is SqueezeNet, which uses even fewer parameters than MobileNet, but it’s optimized mostly for low memory situations, not so much for speed. It also has lower accuracy. Recently a new version was announced, SqueezeNext, and I’m interested in comparing this to MobileNet V2, so I might write a future blog post about this.

- BinaryConnect: Training Deep Neural Networks with binary weights during propagations
  - You can even squeeze a network down to 1-bit.
